      <description>Why to analyze? To solve a single problem, there may be many different algorithms. Should we just randomly pick up one or use the best one? Of course, we want the best one. But how can we assert that this one is better than that one? Even though we have the best one, is it really the best one in the world? Can there be a better undiscovered algorithm?
We must analyze algorithms to:</description>

      <description>Theses days, I took a MOOC course named Algorithms instructed by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne from Princton University. To solidify my understanding of the course and for future reference, I&amp;rsquo;m going to write some notes on the subject. And from this post on, I decide to write technical articles in English, which is a good way to improve my written English skill.
Basic steps There are some steps we can follow to develop a usable algorithm.</description>
